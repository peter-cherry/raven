## ⚡ Quick Usage

### With Claude Code in Terminal

Every time you open Claude, tell him:

```bash
"Read the landing-page-skill/SKILL.md file and use it when creating landing pages"
```

Then you can simply say:

```
"Create a landing page with:
- Hero section with title 'My Product' and subtitle 'Best in class'
- 3 stat cards showing our metrics
- Feature section with 6 features
- CTA section at the bottom"
```

Claude will automatically use the components and design tokens!

## 🎨 Design System

All components use your `globals.css` tokens:
- ✅ Colors: `--bg-primary`, `--accent-primary`, `--text-primary`
- ✅ Typography: `--font-section-title`, `--font-text-body`
- ✅ Spacing: `--spacing-xs` through `--spacing-5xl`
- ✅ Containers: `--container-bg`, `--container-border`

## 📋 Command Examples

### Simple Landing Page
```
"Create a landing page with Hero + CTA"
```

### Feature Showcase
```
"Build a landing page with:
- Hero: 'Trade Platform'
- 3 stat cards (jobs, techs, matches)
- 6 features in 3 columns
- Final CTA section"
```

### Custom Layout
```
"Create a landing page with:
- Left-aligned hero with image
- Stats section with 4 metrics
- Feature section with 2-column layout
- Compact CTA"
```

## 🎯 Pro Tips

1. **Always mention the skill**: "Using the landing-page-skill..."
2. **Use specific numbers**: "3 stat cards", "6 features in 2 columns"
3. **Reference wireframe**: "Like the Trade Services dashboard"
4. **Specify variants**: "purple stat card", "compact CTA"

## 🔄 Updating Claude's Memory

Tell Claude once:
```
"Remember: Always read landing-page-skill/SKILL.md before creating landing pages. Use the components from this skill and follow the design tokens in globals.css."
```
